**Reflection**: Working on Flirt Fork has been a remarkable journey where I not only applied my software engineering skills but also developed new ones. Crafting features like the `Smart Itinerary` challenged my problem-solving abilities and enhanced my understanding of user-centric design. Collaborating with the team, mentoring, and contributing to the CS2113 community were equally fulfilling experiences that underscored the importance of teamwork and knowledge sharing.
