## Project: Flirt & Fork

_Flirt & Fork_ is a CLI-based dating application designed to simplify and enhance the dating experience, offering a unique blend of functionality and creativity in planning dates.

### Summary of Contributions

Given below are my contributions to the project.

**New features added and enhancements to existing feature**

Introduced `GenerateGiftCommand`, a gift idea generator feature  aimed at assisting users who may struggle with gift-giving decisions.
- Designed and populated the gift database with a diverse collection of gift ideas categorised by gender demographics.
- Developed the feature logic, including algorithms to randomly generate gift suggestions [#84](https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2113-T11-2/tp/pull/84).
- Enhanced the gift idea generator feature by adding gender-specific filters (`male`, `female`, and `unisex`) [#193](https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2113-T11-2/tp/pull/193).
- Integrated the feature into the existing app interface with instructions.
- Enhanced `ListOptionsCommand` to allow for continuous listing until a "cancel" command is issued, enhancing user flexibility and control [#188](https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2113-T11-2/tp/pull/188).

**Challenges overcome**
- Encountered initial difficulties with filtering algorithms, which were resolved through adopting the Java Stream API to efficiently filter gift options based on gender attributes.
- Overcome hurdles related to database integration in JAR file deployment, ensuring users have access to the curated database upon downloading the application [#30](https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2113-T11-2/tp/pull/30).

**Project management and Contributions to Team-Based Tasks**
- Laid the foundational framework of our application, which formed the basic architecture [#9](https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2113-T11-2/tp/pull/9).
  - Developed classes such as `Command`, `Parser`, `UI`, and `Storage` for the rest of the team to build upon.
  - Developed initial implementations for various command classes including `AddActivityCommand`, `ExitCommand`, `FindOptionsCommand` etc.
  - Crafted foundational model classes including `Favourites`, `Activity`, `FavouritesList` and `Food`, setting the data structure and functionalities for managing different data types within the application.
- Crisis management and addressed critical last-minute database access issue discovered before our v1.0 release. 
- Identify bugs related to the database's availability among other usability concerns.

**Testing** [#28](https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2113-T11-2/tp/pull/28), [#201](https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2113-T11-2/tp/pull/201), [#202](https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2113-T11-2/tp/pull/202)
  - Authored JUnit tests for features implemented by me.
  - Add additional JUnit tests for features implemented by other team members (`Paser` and `Ui` classes).

**Documentation**
  - **User Guide:** Revised and update the guide to improve usability [#52](https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2113-T11-2/tp/pull/52), [#187](https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2113-T11-2/tp/pull/187).
    - Provided detailed step-by-step instructions supplemented with examples to facilitate user understanding.
    - Logical organisation of content to guide users through the application's features.
  - **Developer Guide:** Managed the documentation for the gift feature [#204](https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2113-T11-2/tp/pull/204).
    - Updated the guide to include implementation and operational logic of the gift suggestion feature.
    - Updated sequence diagram to illustrate the process flow for generating new gift suggestions.
    - Refined class diagram to depict the structural relationships and design of the gift feature.
