## Project: Flirt & Fork

_Flirt & Fork_ is a CLI-based dating application designed to simplify and enhance the dating experience, offering a unique blend of functionality and creativity in planning dates. 

The application excels in generating personalised date itineraries and incorporates a variety of features that allow users to discover options. 

### Summary of Contributions

Given below are my contributions to the project.

**New features added and enhancements to existing feature**

Introduced a gift idea generator feature aimed at assisting users who may struggle with gift-giving decisions.
- Designed and populated a comprehensive gift database with a diverse collection of gift ideas categorised by interest and gender demographics.
- Developed the feature logic, including algorithms to randomly generate gift suggestions. 
- Enhanced the gift idea generator feature by adding gender-specific filters (`male`, `female`, and `unisex`).
- Integrated the feature into the existing app interface with instructions.

**Challenges overcome**
- Encountered initial difficulties with filtering algorithms, which were resolved through adopting the Java Stream API to efficiently filter gift options based on gender.

**Project management and Contributions to Team-Based Tasks**
- Laid the foundational framework of our application, which formed the basic architecture and included essential classes such as `Command`, `Parser`, `UI`, and `Storage` for the rest of the team to build upon.
- Explain the workings of the Command abstract class that was central to the application's operation.
- Crisis management and addressed critical last-minute database access issue discovered before our v1.0 release. Successfully resolved the issue by refining the code and restructuring the file path to source the database from `src > resources` instead of `out > data`.
- Identify bugs related to the database's availability in the JAR deployment among other usability concerns.

**Code contributed**
  - Contributed over 1,000 lines of code, encompassing backend logic for new features and database integration.

**Testing** 
  - Authored JUnit tests for features implemented by me
  - Add additional JUnit tests for features implemented by other team members (`Parser class`)


**Documentation**
  - **User Guide:** Update the user guide for both the feature I wrote and what my teammates wrote.
    - Provided a clear, structured instructions with extensive examples to demonstrate our app.
    - Language simplification to ensure accessibility to users of varying language proficiency.
    - Logical organisation of content to guide users through the application's features.
  - **Developer Guide:** Took ownership of the section for gift feature, crafting detailed explanations of its implementation and functionality.
    - Updated the guide to include a thorough explanation of the feature's logic and use cases.
    - Updated sequence diagram illustrating the flow of operations when users generate a new gift suggestion.
    - Updated class diagram to reflect the design and relationships within the gift feature codebase.
